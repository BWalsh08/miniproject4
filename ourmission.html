            <h3><a href="ourmission.html"></a>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>We asked ourselves, "How might we redesign access for low income, black-minority families to receive safe donated youth sport equipment?" Creating a website where our avatar can apply for youth sport equipment. The application requires legitimate finances and equitability along with demographics and current living situation from the family as to determine priority. The request form gives the family/community to seek equipment, that can be either used or new, that is donated from retailers we are currently working with. The idea is that these families, due to having low-income, can afford the entry fee and travel costs for their youth athletes to play but can’t afford the cost of equipment. With the equipment coming at no cost thanks to our non-profit organization, a family (usually a minority) can afford for their athlete to play more than one sport. Working with All Kids Play to reach an audience similar to our avatar (families that cannot afford youth sport play) so we can reach out and offer our assistance. This is an organization that financially assists families  that do not have access to the resources and education on youth sports. We would also look to use some of the donations provided to All Kids Play to use when we are connecting with larger sports organizations/retailers (Dick’s Sporting Goods, Nike, Under Armour, etc.) to seek donations or cheaper alternatives. We are not always going to be donating equipment from these larger corporations, however, with the use of not only our resources but the money donated to All Kids Play, we can have access to more equipment that can be donated to the families.</p>
