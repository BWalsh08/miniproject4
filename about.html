            <h3><a href="#about"></a>Who We Work With</h3>
            <p>There are many non-profit organizations that are seeking donations to offer funds/grants to families of youth-athletes to allow kids to have an opportunity to play sports. All Kids Play already is an established non-profit organization that seeks to help a similar demographic we are targeting. There is also Every Kid Sports where their mission is to help kids from income-restricted families to participate in youth sports. Another non-profit organization is Ball to All which has raised $140,000 in donations in order to “keep kids playing”. Their mission is simple in “Every kid can have a ball” with the idea that this will help the kids grow healthier, happier and at the same time, keep them out of trouble. The difference here is their avatar is to help those in Africa. A more similar non-profit organization is Goodsports who seeks not only donations for high-need communities, but it's a hub for “equip-a-kid” where people can donate their equipment. They believe that by supplying youth sport organizations with gear they need, it can cut costs for these organizations which allows them to have more resources available.</p>
            <h3><a href="products"></a>Research</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Our research shows that there exists a gap in fair youth sports play that is significantly large between a white family with significant household income and a black/minority family with low household income.  Research has shown that youth sport can have a lasting impact on the general health and wellbeing (Kuhn, 2021).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> Physical activity has also been shown to reduce the risk of obesity, promote better cardiovascular health, increased mental health, and improved academic performance (Tandon, 2021).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> Unfortunately, even though sport is advertised as an equal playing field for kids across the socioeconomic ladder, there are still many barriers that block participation for lower income families. One of these barriers is the inability to purchase increasingly expensive sporting equipment.</p>
